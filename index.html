        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Interested in reducing your household’s food waste? On average, people waste 25% of the food they buy. This is a waste of the resources it took to produce that food and a giant waste of money for the individual. The average household of four throws away an estimated $1,350 to $2,275 per year in wasted food.

            We have tips and tricks for helping you figure out how to waste less; guidance on saving scraps for municipal compost; instructions for starting your own backyard compost pile, or even letting worms do the work in an under-the-counter vermicomposting bin.
            
            Wasted food isn’t the only thing clogging up landfills: we use and then throw out a lot of food packaging, mostly in the form of plastic containers and bags. But with a few changes to the way you shop, cook, eat and deal with leftovers, you’ll be able to reduce your foodprint and save money too.
